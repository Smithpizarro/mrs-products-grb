# Backend dev mrs-products-grb

We want a function in the company to show the price list, we have the PRICES table that reflects the final price (pvp), the brandId that is the identifier of the group chain and the rate that applies to a product of a chain between certain dates.
You want to build a service in SpringBoot that provides a query rest end point such that:
 
Accept as input parameters: application date, product identifier, string identifier.
Return as output data: product identifier, string identifier, rate to apply, application dates and final price to apply.

**Create a Spring boot application that exposes the agreed REST API on port 8092.**

Below is the diagram of the test scenarios [Here]
